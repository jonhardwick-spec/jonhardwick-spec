### 🚀 About Me

I’m a self-taught software engineer whose journey began with building my first computer at age ten and writing code at eleven—mainly in **Java** and **Python**. Diagnosed with autism, my special interest in computers and computer science drives me to learn, experiment, and push boundaries far beyond traditional education.

Much of my code is written for laughs, but some projects—like [Eris Protection](https://github.com/Cryptic-Solutions/Eris-Protection)—are genuinely impactful, especially in **server security** and **deployment**.  
I believe in serious intellect over stiff professionalism, and while my code practices may raise eyebrows (thanks partly to the wild teams I’ve worked with), they never cross ethical lines.

**Collected Professional Opinion**

Professional Opinion from associate working as a SE @ large cyber security firm (prefers to remain anonymous):  
> Jon, with nickname given by peers due to his size "Big Jawn", and former online alias "Spec", displays notable technical creativity and unconventional approach in software engineering, especially in Java and Python. 

> Despite showing he’s capable of using proper naming conventions and following strict dev ops guidelines, his code reveals a blend of humor and meme culture, with distinctive naming conventions that, while playful, reflect deep familiarity with modern internet trends and youth culture. This is perhaps done to make coding more fun. 

> Working in diverse teams has exposed Jon’s code to a range of naming conventions; he self admits to not condoning nor authorize any unethical or inappropriate identifiers, but claims to have worked with teams that do so. His own work is characterized by ethical standards and innovative solutions, particularly in cyber security and server deployment. 

> Reportedly and demonstratively able to code event systems and GUIs in Java as well as backend deployment ready systems for user management. 

> Self-education and practical experimentation have enabled Jon to achieve advanced technical proficiency, making him well-suited for collaborative, educational, and corporate environments that value originality, adaptability, and real-world problem solving.

**Ethics & Code Transparency Disclaimer:**  
Some older codebases I contributed to may contain questionable or inappropriate naming conventions, including references that could be perceived as racist or sexist—these choices were made by other team members, and I do not condone or support such practices. My own code and contributions uphold respectful and inclusive standards. 

You’ll find my personal naming style is influenced by Gen Z culture, American humor, and TikTok memes, with field names like `JuggTheOpps` and `SwishCheeseThehAss`. I do use camelCase, but my conventions are intentionally playful, designed to bring levity to development.


**AI and The Cloud**
I’ve taught myself how to deploy local AI models and train them from scratch, and I love demonstrating knowledge that typically takes years of formal study. My work is proof that passion and self-education can rival any certification. 

In a personal project I used PyTorch to deploy a localized version of QWEN-Coder 32b instruct and de-trained the inaccurate history and restrictions set in place by CCP rules. 

Qwen exhibits extreme coding abilities, but is hampered by Chinese propaganda.

To break it down in to more comprehensible terms without describing exact process:

I de-tuned the propaganda out of the pre and post trained data sets using pytorch and a custom designed training pathway, then combined both sets to achieve a proper model.

I will be posting this project within the next two years once AI hype dies down.

> If you’re searching for my earlier work, it’s still there!

### 🤖 Fun Facts

- Diagnosed with extremely high functioning autism; peers have struggled to pick up on developmental disability due to enhanced masking and advanced self awareness combined with psychological study; special interest in computers, computer sciences, electrical blue collar work and welding.
- Built first computer at age 10 and started coding at 11
- Self-educated in all things tech (no formal certifications)
- Can deploy and train local AI models from scratch, and create custom training pathways as specified, including the offloading of training processing power to 3rd party GPU/VPS providers.
- Demonstrates advanced technical knowledge often reserved for degree-holders
- Java and Python specialist; understands basic JavaScript
- Field naming conventions inspired by Gen Z humor, memes, and American slang, can use professional field naming conventions if required by project goals, prefers to be funny.

### 😁 Long Term Goal
> Custom build a small server complex housed within 1-2 storage container units using combined knowledge of electrical, welding, and computer science.
> This will cost me roughly $20,000-$140,000 and could perhaps be obtained through business loan or VC funding for an AI project I have already obtained a Provisional Utility Patent for. If you’re interested in funding it, your ROI will directly correlate to the % rate of funding out of total funding you have provided, capped at 40%. Estimated earnings gross a MMR of 5k+.
